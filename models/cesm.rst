CESM model 
==========

Brief description of model
--------------------------
The Community Earth System Model (CESM) is a state-of-the-art, fully coupled, global climate model that developed by the Climate and Global Dynamics Laboratory (CGD) at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).

The latest CESM version
--------------------------
The current CESM release is CESM 2.1.0 which is also used for CMIP6 experiments. The recent developments in CESM2 are explained here: http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/cesm2/whatsnew.html 

How to download?
--------------------------
To download the current release :

``git clone -b release-cesm2.1.0 https://github.com/ESCOMP/cesm.git my_cesm``
``cd my_cesm``
``./manage_externals/checkout_externals``

CESM2 documentation is here : https://escomp.github.io/cesm/release-cesm2/ 

Simpler Models
--------------------------
The CESM team also released several simpler configurations of CESM2. Currently available simpler atmosphere (CAM) models are listed here : http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/simpler-models

The CESM Working Groups
--------------------------
The CESM Working Groups are responsible for development and improvement of the CESM. Scientists in each group meet regularly at least once a year. Information on working groups for each component model and several specific application topics can be found here : http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working_groups/ 

How to acknowledge CESM?
--------------------------
CESM is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). If you use CESM model or simulations, it is important to acknowledge the sponsors. Acknowledgment examples are provided here : http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/publications/
