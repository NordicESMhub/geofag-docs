ECMWF data
==========

All public datasets can now be accessed and retrieved from the Climate Data Store at https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu

Information on how to migrate from ECMWF API to CDS API is available at https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/C3S+ERA5%3A+Web+API+to+CDS+API

The link above is also useful to get information on datasets that are not yet officialy available from the Climate Data Store (for instance ERA5 monthly means of daily means).
